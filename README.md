# IRISFLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’.
The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
In this project, we’ll solve the problem using a supervised learning approach. We’ll use an algorithm called “Support vector machine”.

Support vector machine: A support vector machine (also known as a support vector network) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression. 
SVMs are one of the most robust classifications methods.

SVM approximates a separate line (Hyperplane) between two classes
SVM algorithm finds the points closest to the line from both classes. These points are known as support vectors. Then it computes the distance between the line and support vectors. This distance is called the margin.
The main goal is to maximize the margin. The hyperplane which has the maximum margin is known as the optimal hyperplane.

1. Load the data
2. Analyze and visualize the dataset
3. Model training.
4. Model Evaluation.
5. Testing the model

Through this project, we learned about machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, model creation, etc.
